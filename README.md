Analysis of EEG Signals to Understand Impact of Meditation on Concentration

# Abstract
In order to analyze EEG data and estimate a person's degree of concentration, we apply machine learning algorithms. From the EEG signals, we first extract Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) values and plot them against frequency. Then, we compute the intercept, coefficients and R-squared error after fitting a linear regression model to the data. These measures enable us to assess the effectiveness of our model and gauge how well it predicts the concentration level.
Machine learning algorithms can analyze EEG signals and correctly forecast a person's level of concentration. This has significant ramifications for understanding how the human brain functions and for the diagnosis and treatment of neurological illnesses.
